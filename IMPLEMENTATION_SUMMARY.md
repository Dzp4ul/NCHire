# NCHire System Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes (Session 2)

### 1. **My Applications** ‚úì
- **Date Format**: Changed from "M d, Y" to "MM/DD/YYYY" (e.g., `11/11/2025`)
- **Delete Button**: Changed from trash icon (`ri-delete-bin-line`) to close/X icon (`ri-close-line`)
- **Files Modified**: `user/user_application.php`

### 2. **Profile Dropdown** ‚úì
- **Removed Options**: 
  - View Profile
  - Settings
- **Kept**: Sign Out only
- **Files Modified**: `user/user.php`

### 3. **Auto-Navigate After Signup** ‚úì
- **Behavior**: After email verification success popup (auto-closes after 5 seconds or manual close), the system automatically:
  1. Closes verification modal
  2. Opens sign-in modal
  3. User can immediately sign in with their new credentials
- **Files Modified**: `index.php` (closeVerificationPopup function)

### 4. **Admin Search Bar** ‚úì
- **Removed**: Search bar from admin dashboard header
- **Files Modified**: `admin/index.php`

### 5. **Fixed Applicant Count Discrepancy** ‚úì
- **Problem**: Dashboard showed 5 total applicants but Applications page showed only 4
- **Root Cause**: API was using old JSON file system instead of database
- **Solution**: Replaced file-based storage with direct database queries
- **Files Modified**: `admin/api/applicants.php`
- **Result**: Both dashboard and applicants page now show same count from database

### 6. **Fixed Wizard Step 2 Color Indicator** ‚úì
- **Problem**: Step indicator wasn't changing color when moving to Step 2
- **Solution**: Added `window.currentWorkflowStep = 2` when "Continue to Documents" button is clicked
- **Files Modified**: `user/user.php` (toStep2 event handler)
- **Result**: Step indicator now properly updates to yellow/active when user proceeds to document upload

### 7. **Fixed Admin Notifications & Settings Buttons** ‚úì
- **Problem**: Buttons were not responding to clicks
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `id="notificationBtn"` and `id="settingsBtn"` to button elements
  - Implemented click event handlers with placeholder alerts
- **Files Modified**: `admin/index.php`
- **Result**: Buttons now respond with "Coming Soon" messages explaining future functionality

### 8. **Page State Persistence on Refresh** ‚úì
- **Problem**: Page always returned to Dashboard when refreshed
- **Solution**: Enhanced localStorage implementation to restore last viewed section
- **Implementation**:
  - localStorage already saved active section
  - Added auto-load logic on page load based on saved state
  - Now automatically loads My Applications or Profile content if that was the last viewed section
- **Files Modified**: `user/user.php`
- **Result**: Users stay on same page (Dashboard/Applications/Profile) after refresh

### 9. **Work Experience/Education/Skills Count in Wizard Step 1** ‚úì
- **Problem**: No visual indication of how many items exist in user's profile
- **Solution**: Added count badges next to section titles
- **Implementation**:
  - Added blue badge for Work Experience count
  - Added green badge for Skills count
  - Badges update dynamically when data loads
  - Show "0" when no items exist
- **Files Modified**: `user/user.php`
- **Result**: Users can see at a glance: "Work Experience (1)" and "Skills & Competencies (5)"

### 10. **Account Settings Cleanup** ‚úì
- **Problem**: Too many unused settings options (Email Preferences, Notifications, Danger Zone)
- **Solution**: Simplified to show only password change
- **Implementation**:
  - Removed Email Preferences section
  - Removed Notification Settings toggle
  - Removed Delete Account danger zone
  - Added helpful description and placeholders
  - Added Cancel button for better UX
  - Enhanced input IDs for future backend integration
- **Files Modified**: `user/user_profile.php`
- **Result**: Clean, focused Account Settings with only password management

### 11. **Department Filter with 'All Departments' Label** ‚úì
- **Problem**: No clear indication when viewing all departments
- **Solution**: Added "All Departments" label in upper right when no filters active
- **Implementation**:
  - Modified `updateActiveFilters()` function
  - Shows "All Departments" label when no filters are selected
  - Active filters display with X buttons as before
  - Label appears in filter tag container (upper right)
- **Files Modified**: `user/user.php`
- **Result**: Users see "All Departments" label when browsing all jobs; filters show with X buttons when active

### 12. **Clickable Notifications Implementation Guide** ‚úì
- **Status**: Comprehensive guide created (requires database changes)
- **Guide Includes**:
  - Database schema modifications (ALTER TABLE)
  - Backend integration steps
  - Frontend click handling
  - Navigation routing logic
  - URL patterns for different notification types
  - Testing checklist
- **Files Created**: `CLICKABLE_NOTIFICATIONS_GUIDE.md`
- **Note**: Requires database changes before implementation

## ‚ùì Questions Answered

### Q1: How is the dean account created? Is there a main admin account?

**Answer**: 
The system currently has an **admin_users** table (based on memory) with roles including:
- Admin
- HR Manager
- Department Head
- Recruiter

**Recommendation**:
1. **Main Admin (Super Admin)**: Should be the highest privilege level
   - Can create/manage all user types including deans
   - Full system access
   
2. **Dean Accounts**: Should be created by Main Admin
   - Department-specific access
   - Can view applicants for their department
   - Cannot manage other deans or system-wide settings

3. **Implementation**:
   - Add user creation interface in admin/Users section
   - Main admin can assign "Dean" role during user creation
   - Dean role should have department assignment

### Q2: Should the dean see all user accounts, or should only main admin see all users?

**Answer**: 
**Recommended Access Levels**:

**Main Admin (Super Admin)**:
- ‚úÖ See ALL users (applicants, deans, admins, HR staff)
- ‚úÖ Manage all accounts
- ‚úÖ System-wide permissions

**Dean**:
- ‚úÖ See only applicants who applied to their department
- ‚úÖ See other deans (read-only, for collaboration)
- ‚ùå Cannot see admin accounts
- ‚ùå Cannot manage other user accounts
- ‚úÖ Can view/manage applications for their department only

**Implementation**: Add role-based access control (RBAC) in queries:
```php
if ($user_role === 'dean') {
    // Filter by department
    $dept = $_SESSION['user_department'];
    $query = "WHERE department = '$dept'";
} else if ($user_role === 'admin') {
    // No filter - see everything
    $query = "";
}
```

### Q3: On dean's dashboard, should active users still be displayed, or only total applicants and list of applicants?

**Answer**:
**Recommended Dashboard for Dean**:
- ‚úÖ **Total Applicants** (for their department only)
- ‚úÖ **Pending Reviews** (for their department)
- ‚úÖ **Interview Scheduled** (for their department)
- ‚úÖ **Hired** (for their department)
- ‚úÖ **List of Applicants** (department-specific)
- ‚ùå Remove "Active Users" (this is system-wide metric, not relevant to department dean)

Replace "Active Users" card with department-specific metric like:
- **Accepted Applicants**
- **Rejected Applications**
- **Applications This Month**

### Q4: When clicking profile picture beside settings icon, should it redirect to Profile page?

**Answer**: 
**Yes, recommended behavior**:
- Clicking profile picture ‚Üí Navigate to Profile page/section
- Clicking dropdown arrow ‚Üí Show dropdown menu (Sign Out only now)

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// In user.php
profilePictureElement.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    if (!e.target.closest('.dropdown-arrow')) {
        // Load profile section
        loadSection('profile');
        updateActiveNavigation('profile');
    }
});
```

## üí° Suggestions Discussion

### Account Settings - Code Requirement Before Password Change
**Question**: Should settings interface appear immediately, or require a code first before showing password section?

**Recommendation**: 
**Require verification code for security**:
1. User clicks "Change Password"
2. System sends verification code to user's email
3. User enters code
4. Password change form appears

**Benefits**:
- Extra security layer
- Prevents unauthorized password changes if user leaves session unattended
- Follows best security practices

**Alternative**: 
- Require current password before changing (simpler, still secure)

### Google Sign-In Integration
**"Continue with Google" Functionality**

**Implementation Requirements**:
1. Register app with Google OAuth 2.0
2. Get Client ID and Client Secret
3. Add Google Sign-In button to signin/signup modals
4. Handle OAuth callback
5. Create/link user accounts

**Benefits**:
- Faster signup/signin
- No password to remember
- Better user experience

**Recommendation**: Implement as Phase 2 feature after core system is stable
