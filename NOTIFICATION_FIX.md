# Notification System Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Notifications Not Showing** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Database insert was failing due to incorrect parameter types
**Solution**: Fixed `bind_param` in `admin_notification_helper.php`
- Changed from `"ssssss"` to `"ssssis"` 
- `applicant_id` is now correctly treated as integer (i) instead of string (s)

### 2. **Admin Can Delete Own Account** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Admins could delete their own account
**Solution**: Added double protection:
- **Frontend** (`admin.js`): Shows error toast before confirmation
- **Backend** (`api/users.php`): Blocks the API request with error message

### 3. **Email Notifications Not Sending** - Should Work Now ✅
**Issue**: Was blocked by the first bug (database insert failing)
**Status**: Now that notifications are created successfully, emails should send

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If Notifications Still Don't Show**:

1. **Check Database Table**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM admin_notifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   If empty, table might not exist.

2. **Run Setup**:
   ```
   http://localhost/FinalResearch - Copy/admin/setup_notifications.php
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check Network tab for failed API calls

4. **Check PHP Error Log**:
   - Look in XAMPP error logs
   - Should see: "Admin notification created: [title]"

### **If Emails Don't Send**:

1. **Check Gmail Settings**:
   - Gmail account must allow "Less secure app access" OR
   - Use App Password (recommended)

2. **Test Email Function**:
   - Schedule an interview
   - Check PHP error log for email success/failure

3. **Verify Active Admins**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM admin_users WHERE status = 'Active';
   ```
   Must have at least 1 active admin
